# Object-Detection
Object Detection using YOLO with OpenCV   Build a computer vision model to keep eye on traffic.    You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a clever convolutional neural network (CNN) for doing object detection in real-time. The algorithm applies a single neural network to the frame, and then divides the frame into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.    This model has a number of benefits over other object detection methods:    -YOLO is extremely fast  -YOLO sees the entire frame during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance.  -YOLO learns generalize representations of objects so that when trained on natural frames and tested on artwork, the algorithm outperforms other top detection methods.
